        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs -- During my time at Miami I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
          I  was a *graduate assistant* at Miami and spent two semesters leading lab sessions for statistics courses for the undergraduate students. I also worked as a statistical consultant for the *Practicuum in Data Analysis* coursework and gained hands-on experience working with real data and communicating results to the clients.

          During my undergraduate years, I took data analysis and modeling course, which piqued my interest in this field. I was intrigued by how we can analyze historical data to gain insights into the future and make data driven decisions. This led me to pursue actuarial exams and take advanced mathematics courses.
